<!--C#-->
        <p id="cSharp">Based on the answers you provided, it looks like <strong>C#</strong> is the track for you! C# is the most popular among bigger, established businesses, often used to build interal software. Because it has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. If you like the idea of working for a larger company, <strong>C#</strong> is a great choice!</p>
<!--JAVA-->
        <p id="java">Based on the answers you provided, it looks like <strong>JAVA</strong> is the track for you! Java is a favorite of enterprise companies, as well as one of the most popular of all programming languages. It is used in everything from high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been around for a long time and is used in so many applications, it is a very high-demand language. If you are interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, <strong>Java</strong> could be a good language to learn.</p>
<!--PHP-->
        <p id="php">Based on the answers you provided, it looks like <strong>PHP</strong> is the track for you! PHP is most used in content-heavy websites with relatively little user interaction. The most popular content management systems, such as Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla, are all written in PHP. Everything from local restaurants' websites to large complex government deployments are built with these tools. If you're keen to work for an agency that builds websites for clients, or if you like the idea of building sites for brands, businesses, and organizations, <strong>PHP</strong> is a great direction to go.</p>
<!--Ruby-->
        <p id="ruby">Based on the answers you provided, it looks like <strong>Ruby</strong> is the track for you! Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it's built with Ruby. Ruby is most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly. If that sort of quick interactivity sounds appealing, <strong>Ruby</strong> may be the language for you.</p>
